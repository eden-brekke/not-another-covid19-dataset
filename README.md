# Not Another Covid19 Dataset

[Deployed Site](https://eden-covid19-viz.netlify.app/)

This is a data visualization using the [Pomber API](https://github.com/pomber/covid19) that gathers data from [CSSEGIS](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and updates daily with Covid19 case information.

It was built using React, D3.js and styled with SASS.  
Relied heavily on this source code from [Rishabh Kharbanda](https://github.com/techie448/covid19) who built this website and provided their source within the Pomber API's readme file.
